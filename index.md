# *Hello world!*

Welcome to my stats220 website! 

## About me

I'm a student here in the university of Auckland double majoring in statistics and finance. **Three things I like to do are drinking coffee, taking a beach walk, going on exciting events with my friends.** 

## It's so much fun making memes!

My motivation for making this coronavirus meme was to add a dose of humor or sarcasm about the new realities of life during this pandemic, according to [APA](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/10/covid-19-stress-humor) viewing memes helps to relieve stress and cope better in the era of COVID-19.

What inspired me to create this *original* meme:

1. I wanted to make a meme that's very much relevant to our new reality and how people are coping  
2. I saw a meme of kanye west laughing at covid-19 memes at the start of the pandemic and another picture of him looking traumatized fast-forward 2022 LOL so I thought I should make one![KanyeWestmeme](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/5e740f3207adf00006db9d14/Coronavirus-meme-featuring-Kanye-West--created-by-meme-account--MasiPopal/960x0.jpg?fit=bounds&format=jpg&width=960)
